# Transfer_Learning_PhaseContrast
Codes from our project on classification and characterization of Phase Contrast Images from the human patellar cartilage

We will share some of the codes used to generate some of the results of our paper 
"Deep transfer learning for characterizing chondrocyte patterns in phase contrast X-Ray computed tomography images of the human patellar cartilage" published recently.

This code includes contributions from Botao Deng and Adora D'Souza.

Please cite our paper if you find any of the information in this repository helpful.
